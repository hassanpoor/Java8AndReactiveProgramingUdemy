A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result
 if the same arguments are passed.
 It does not depend on any state or data change during a program's execution. Rather, it only depends on its input arguments

Composition : a.compose(b) means first run b then a run on result of b

Closure: is a function that refer to free variables in lexical context
values in functional must be final ;

for get multiple input must be use function in function
Exp: Function<Long,Function<String,Function<Double,Squre>>> funca

in Functional we are lazy evaluation ,
lazy valuation is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation
of an expression until the value is needed and we can take advantage of this behavior to delaying to even
a wide method invocation or evaluation of an expression because some values might never be needed or
some expressions are never needed to be evaluated depending on some conditions.


Recursion :
1:Tail Recursion :code exp
2:Non Tail Recursion: may be have stack over flow
